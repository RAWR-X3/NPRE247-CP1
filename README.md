# NPRE247-Computer Project 1
### Contents:
- Instruction Manual (README.md)
- Assignment (NPRE247 ComProj 1 Instructions.pdf)
- Code (NPRE247 ComProj 1 Code.py)
- Input CSV (kepdecayinput.csv)
- Output CSV (kepdecayoutput.csv)

### How to use the code:
1. Download the Input CSV, Output CSV, and Code to the same folder.
- To change the tfinal value (determines how long to simulate decay):
  Edit tfinal in line 2 of the Input CSV.
- To change the iterlength value (determines how many timesteps per unit of time, I.E 10 steps per 1 hour vs 1 step per 1 hour):
  Edit iterlength in line 2 of the Input CSV.
2. Run the code twice <ins>from the folder it is located in</ins> with desired values as I was unable to isolate the error causing it not to read the freshly updated version of the output file.
